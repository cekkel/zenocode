## MISSION CRITICAL RULES

1. **Code with elegance** - Write clean, maintainable, and elegant code that follows established patterns.

2. **Follow the paved path** - ULTRA CRITICAL: The `paved path` is the PREFERRED way of doing things. When you encounter `paved path` in any documentation, this indicates the canonical approach that MUST be followed.

3. **User runs the application** - Unless you are running a QA command, you do not run the app. Always ask the user to run the app and report results back to you.

4. **Clarify ambiguity** - Favor asking follow-up questions to ensure clear understanding of requirements before implementation.

5. **Preserve existing functionality** - NEVER reduce the scope of existing features/behaviors unless explicitly instructed to do so.

6. **AGENTS.md as living documentation** - ULTRA CRITICAL: Treat all AGENTS.md files as living API documentation for your future self. Always check for relevant AGENTS.md files and update them when changes impact their accuracy.

7. **Writing expert AGENTS.md files** - Follow the structured format below for clarity and effectiveness.

## AGENTS.MD BEST PRACTICES

### Purpose & Philosophy
- **Living brain**: AGENTS.md files are your persistent memory across sessions
- **API documentation**: Write for your future self as an expert coding agent
- **Token-aware**: Keep concise while preserving critical information
- **Current state only**: Document what IS, not what WAS (no changelogs)

### Structure & Format

#### 1. XML-Style Tags (Semantic Sections)
```markdown
<!-- system_context -->
Brief overview of what this module/system does. Set the stage for understanding.
<!-- /system_context -->

<!-- file_map -->
## FILE MAP
- `/path/to/file` - Brief description
- `/path/to/folder/` - What's in this folder
<!-- /file_map -->

<!-- paved_path -->
## ARCHITECTURE (PAVED PATH)
The canonical way to do things. Battle-tested patterns that MUST be followed.
<!-- /paved_path -->

<!-- patterns -->
## PATTERNS
Common patterns with real code examples from the codebase.
<!-- /patterns -->

<!-- critical_notes -->
## CRITICAL NOTES
- **Bold key points** with brief explanations
- Gotchas and edge cases
- Things that will break if done wrong
<!-- /critical_notes -->
```

#### 1. Code Examples
```rust
// Bad: excessive unwrapping
fn get_name(user_id: u32) -> String {
    let user = get_user(user_id).unwrap();
    user.name.unwrap()
}

// Good: Chain methods instead
fn get_name(user_id: u32) -> String {
    get_user(user_id)
        .and_then(|user| user.name)
        .unwrap_or_else(|| "Unknown".to_string())
}
```

#### 2. Writing Style
- **Terse but complete**: Every word matters
- **Present tense**: "Store manages state" not "Store will manage"
- **Active voice**: "Use this pattern" not "This pattern should be used"
- **Imperatives for rules**: "MUST", "NEVER", "ALWAYS"

### Advanced Techniques
#### Chain of Thought
```markdown
<!-- workflow -->
## WORKFLOW
1. **Find interface** in `/shared/interfaces/market-data-provider.ts`
2. **Create directory** `/integrations/providers/YourProvider/`
3. **Create files** implement provider interface and rate limiting per `/integrations/providers/AGENTS.md`
